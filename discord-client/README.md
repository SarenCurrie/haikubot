# Discord client

## Testing
To run the tests, use the command `npm test` in the `discord-client` directory.

This runs two commands:
 - `eslint .` runs a linter which checks coding style. If this prints out nothing, you're good to go otherwise some style changes are necessary.
 - `mocha` runs the mocha tests in the `test` directory.
